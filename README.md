# Playwright (TS) Project

This repository contains my Playwright project written from scratch using TypeScript. The enclosed code is designed to showcase my skills as an automation engineer and demonstrate my understanding of test automation using Playwright.

## Test Results

An example test run with results can be viewed here --> [Playwright Test Results](https://github.com/QualityOwl/qowl-demo-playwright/actions/runs/14604127605)

## Getting Started

To get started with this solution, you will need the following installed on your local machine:

- Visual Studio Code (latest version)
- Node.js (LTS version)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

  - `git clone https://github.com/QualityOwl/qowl-demo-playwright.git`

5. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.

6. Install the 'Playwright Test for VSCode' extension
   
7. Install Playwright using the following command:
   
  - `npm init playwright@latest`
   
11. For more information on installing Playwright, please review the ['Installation'](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro) documentation.

## Usage

The project contains sample test cases that demonstrate how to use Playwright to automate browser interactions. To run the sample test cases, follow these steps:

1. Open the 'TEST EXPLORER' window in Visual Studio Code by selecting 'Testing' from the activity bar.

2. In the 'TEST EXPLORER' window, select any test case of your choice and click the 'Run Test' button.

3. The browser will launch and the test case will execute. You should see the browser navigate to the Google homepage, complete the test steps, and validate the results.
